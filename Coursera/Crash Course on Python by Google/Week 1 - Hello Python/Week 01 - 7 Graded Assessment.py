"""What is a computer program?
    ( ) A file that gets printed by the Python interpreter.
    ( ) The syntax and semantics of Python.
    ( ) The overview of what the computer will have to do to solve an automation problem.
    ( ) A step-by-step recipe of what needs to be done to complete a task that gets executed by the computer.

"""Whatâ€™s automation?
    ( ) The inputs and outputs of a program.
    ( ) The process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically.
    ( ) The checkout processes at a grocery store.

"""What are some characteristics of the Python programming language? Check all that apply.
    [ ] Python programs are easy to write and understand.
    [ ] The Python interpreter reads our code and transforms it into computer instructions.
    [ ] It's an outdated language that's barely in use anymore.
    [ ] We can practice Python using web interpreters or codepads as well as executing it locally. """


"""How does Python compare to other programming languages?
    ( ) Python is the only programming language that is worth learning.
    ( ) Each programming language has its advantages and disadvantages.
    ( ) It's always better to use an OS specific language like Bash or Powershell than using a generic language like Python.
    ( ) Programming languages are so different that learning a second one is harder than learning the first one. """
