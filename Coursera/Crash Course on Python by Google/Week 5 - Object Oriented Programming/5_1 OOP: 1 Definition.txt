Object Oriented Programming: A way of thinking about implementing our code from real world concept into a syntax
Example: How to you describe an apple to someone who's never seen it before
    1. Apple is fruit
    2. There are different kind of apples
        a. Different color
        b. Different flavor
        c. Different name
The OOP concept is quite similar with previous example, since we have to explain it 'what we want' in a syntax language
since the computer (syntax language) can,t understand what apple is, and we need to explain it

REAL DEFINITION:
OOP is a flexible, powerful paradigm where classes represent and define concepts, 
while objects are instances of classes"""

Elements under the Class
    # Attributes: characteristics associated to a type
        on the Apple Class, the attributes are the color and flavor
    # Methods: the functions associated to a type
        any action that we will execute on the apple (e.g: slice, bite, throw, eat, etc)
