    "1. When we process an event, we'll see that someone interacted with a machine.\n",
    "    - Event type ***login***: add it to the group of users logged into that machine.\n",
    "    - Event type ***logout***: remove it from the group of users logged into the machine.\n",
    "2. In this scenario, it makes sense to use a <font color = orange>set</font> to store the current users. Adding new users at login time and removing them at logout time before storing it under <font color = lime>dictionary</font>\n",
    "    - We'll use the *name of the machine* as the **key** and the *current users* of that machine as the **value**\n",
    "3. For each event we process, we'll first check in the dictionary to see if the machine is already there or not\n",
    "    - If Exist: we'll update the existing entry with the action corresponding to the event.\n",
    "     - If not exist: create a new entry.\n",
    "4. Print a report of the information we generated\n",
    "    - Define new function to receive the dictionary regenerated and print the report\n",
    "        - Functions to proccessing the data\n",
