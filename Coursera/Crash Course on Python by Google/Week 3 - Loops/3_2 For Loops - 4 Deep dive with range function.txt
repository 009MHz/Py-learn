Previously we had used the range() function by passing it a single parameter, and it generated a sequence of numbers
from 0 to one less than we specified. But the range() function can do much more than that. We can pass in two
parameters: the first specifying our starting point, the second specifying the end point. Don't forget that the
sequence generated won't contain the last element; it will stop one before the parameter specified.

The range() function can take a third parameter, too. This third parameter lets you  alter the size of each step.
So instead of creating a sequence of numbers incremented by 1, you can generate a sequence of numbers that are
incremented by 5.

To quickly recap the range() function when passing one, two, or three parameters:
    - One parameter will create a sequence, one-by-one, from zero to one less than the parameter.
    - Two parameters will create a sequence, one-by-one, from the first parameter to one less than the second parameter.
    - Three parameters will create a sequence starting with the first parameter and stopping before the second parameter,
    but this time increasing each step by the third parameter.
