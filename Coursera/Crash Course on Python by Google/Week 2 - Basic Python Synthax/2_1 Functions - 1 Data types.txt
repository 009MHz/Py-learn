Why does this code raise an error:
print("1234"+5678)
    ( ) Because Python doesn't know how to add a number to a string.
    ( ) Because in Python it's only possible to add numbers, not strings.
    ( ) Because in Python it's not possible to print integers.
    ( ) Because numbers shouldn't be written between quotes.

###RECAP###
In Python, text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. An integer is a whole
number, without a fraction, while a float is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342
are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may
encounter a TypeError. You can always check the data type of something using the type() function.
