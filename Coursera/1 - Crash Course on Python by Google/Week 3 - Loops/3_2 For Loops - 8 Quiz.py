"""Question 1
How are while loops and for loops different in Python?
    ( ) While loops can be used with all data types, for loops can only be used with numbers.
    ( ) For loops can be nested, but while loops can't.
    ( ) While loops iterate while a condition is true, for loops iterate through a sequence of elements.
    ( ) While loops can be interrupted using break, for loops using continue."""

Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n. Then, print the first 
10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number. Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the 
product of an integer and all integers before it. For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1*2*3*4*5=120. 
Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1. """
