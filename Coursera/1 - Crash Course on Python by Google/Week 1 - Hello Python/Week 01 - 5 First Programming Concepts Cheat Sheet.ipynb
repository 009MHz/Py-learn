    "<font color = orange>***Functions***</font> are pieces of code that perform a unit of work. In the examples we've seen so far, we've only encountered the <font color = lime>**print**</font><font color = magenta>()</font> function, which prints a message to the screen. We'll learn about a lot of other functions in later lessons but, if you're too curious to wait until then, you can discover all the functions available here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color = orange>**Keywords**</font> are reserved words that are used to construct instructions. We briefly encountered for and in in our first Python example, and we'll use a bunch of other keywords as we go through the course. For reference, these are all the reserved keywords:\n",
