    "File objects can be opened in several different modes. <font color = orange>A ***mode***</font> is similar to a file permission. It governs what you can do with the file you've just opened. By default, the open function uses ***the r mode***, which stands for ***read only***. You get an error if you try to write to a file opened in read only mode. Since read only is the default, we don't have to pass the R as a second argument when we just want to read the file.\n",
