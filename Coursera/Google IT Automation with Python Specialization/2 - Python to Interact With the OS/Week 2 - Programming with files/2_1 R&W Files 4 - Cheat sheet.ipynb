    "Open *file* and return a corresponding [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object). If the file cannot be opened, an OSError is raised.

    "*file* is a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object) giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is closed unless *closefd* is set to `False`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*mode* is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to `'r'` which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are `'w'` for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), `'x'` for exclusive creation, and `'a'` for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform-dependent: [locale.getencoding()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#locale.getencoding) is called to get the current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are:"
