    "2. there's a limited number of file descriptors that you can create before your file system runs out of them. Although this number might be high, it's possible to open a lot of files and deplete your file system resources. This can happen if we're opening files in a loop.\n",
    "3. leaving open files hanging around ***can lead to race conditions which occur when multiple processes try to modify and read from one resource at the same time*** and can cause all sorts of unexpected behavior. No one wins in a race condition"
