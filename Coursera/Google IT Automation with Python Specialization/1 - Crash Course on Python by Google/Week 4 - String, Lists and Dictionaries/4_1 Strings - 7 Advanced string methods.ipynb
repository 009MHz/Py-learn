    "The string method lower will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the upper method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like \"this is a string\".upper(). This would return the string \"THIS IS A STRING\". This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases."
