    "# Conditionals Cheat Sheet\n",
    "In earlier videos, we took a look at some of the built-in Python operators that allow us to compare values, and some logical operators we can use to combine values. We also learned how to use operators in if-else-elif blocks. \n",

    "Itâ€™s a lot to learn but, with practice, it gets easier to remember it all. In the meantime, this handy cheat sheet gives you all the information you need at a glance. "
